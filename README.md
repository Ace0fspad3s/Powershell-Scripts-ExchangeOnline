# Powershell Scripts for Exchange Online
This was a collection of Powershell scripts to help me automate some Microsoft Exchange Admin tasks at my previous employer.
Main goals were to automate the process of unblocking mobile devices that were enrolled to the MS Outlook mobile app, which were quarantined by default.
Once the devices were cleared, these scripts were ran to unblock them enmasse.

Scripts has been modified to obscure usernames, domains, and some system paths.
These will need to be adjusted before running.
